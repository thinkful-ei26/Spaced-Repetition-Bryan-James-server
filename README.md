# Easy as Pie-thon

An application for learning the Python Programming language using the Spaced Repetition Algorithm

## About

Easy as Python is an easy to use app for memorizing some Python code. Users can read simple facts about the Python programming language. Registering for the App allows the user to login to store their progress and get a score depending on how many questions they have answered correctly. There's also a trial mode for learning with having to create an account, but progress tracking is disabled.
